# [Ocean data challenge: GitHub Developer Dynamics](https://competitions.desights.ai/challenge/25)

## Overview

This report analyzes the relationship between GitHub developer activity and token prices for six cryptocurrency projects:

1. BitTensor
2. Fetch.AI
3. Numer.AI
4. Ocean Protocol
5. Orachain
6. SingularityNET

The analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations between developer contributions and token prices.

## Methodology

- **Data sources**: Commit histories, issue records, repository information, and pricing details
- **Time frame**: Weekly and monthly aggregations
- **Metrics**: Number of commits, opened issues, closed issues, unresolved issues
- **Analysis techniques**: 
  - Developer activity trends
  - Repository activity analysis
  - Most active developers identification
  - Correlation analysis (heatmaps, rolling correlations, time lags)

## Key Findings

1. Developer activity alone is not a reliable predictor of cryptocurrency price changes across projects.
2. The relationship between GitHub activity and token prices is highly individualized for each project.
3. In some cases, increased developer activity preceded important project milestones or updates.
4. No consistent time lag was found between developer activity and price movements across all projects.
5. BitTensor emerged as the most actively developed project based on commits, issues, and repositories created per month.

## Conclusion

While developer activity is crucial for a project's growth, its correlation with token prices varies significantly among projects. A more comprehensive analysis incorporating additional factors such as social media activity, partnership announcements, and broader market trends might yield more robust insights into project success and token price movements.
